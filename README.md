This package is a clone of the famous [react-toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/) library.

Motivations: At the time of writing this, the existing packages for toast offer minimal options, and your only fallback are banners and the snack bar from the material team. I wanted to provide an alternative to the existing solutions and porting React-Toastify to Flutter was on my to-do list.

This package is in development\*, and might not be used in production until the first stable release is announced.

Just so you know, I'm currently employed full time and this project might take some time to see the light.
